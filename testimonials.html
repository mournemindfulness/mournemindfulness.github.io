                <h1>Testimonials</h1>

                <p>I completed the MBSR course with Deirdre last year in the wonderful surroundings of the Mourne Mountains.  Initially I was a bit worried about committing to 8 weeks as I was in the middle of moving house and I thought it would be difficult to ‘make the time’, but the programme became a real anchor for me.  I found the different meditation practices, such as the body scan and the 3 minute breathing space, a great way to help me switch off, slow down and ‘be in the moment’.</p>

                <p>One of the great benefits for me was practising each week with other people and being given the space to honestly reflect on how my practice had been the week before.  Deirdre’s encouragement, guidance and support throughout the 8 weeks was brilliant.  We were able to contact her between sessions and she always helped us to find a way to embrace the practice in our day-to-day lives.</p>

                <p>Since completing the course I have tried to practice on a daily basis.  There have been days when I avoid it and don’t make the time but then I feel out of sorts and that’s when I get back on my meditation stool and start again.</p>

                <br>

                <p>I attended this eight week programme because I wanted to gain more patience and to take time for myself. Deirdre you are a super facilitator, very aware of the needs of the group and of giving participants  time to reflect and share their experiences.</p>
                <p>Mindfulness has become so deeply relevant in my life - the breath has become my anchor to being aware of thoughts and actions (well most of the time) and this is having such a positive effect on my well-being.  I feel truly in touch with myself for the first time in a long time!! In my family life I find myself using some skills to make small changes with BIG effects.</p>

                <p>What have I gained form this course? Acceptance that I am human, that it is Ok that at time my mind races, that it is Ok that I am often thinking about the future. That I'm OK. It has affirmed many of the things that I find nourishing but which I felt guilty taking time for. Now I am happy to take time for these things.</p>

                <p>It has been a truly fascinating, uplifting but also difficult 8 weeks. I have thoroughly enjoyed looking inside and getting to know me again. It has been very meaningful and profound - I have been recommending to friends and family. Thank you Deirdre - you are a very lovely and sincere person - you deserve peace and happiness.</p>

                <p>I was amazed by this programme that in such a short time such a great depth of knowledge is offered and a great breadth of application is elaborated. I now see Mindfulness practice as an absolute must in modern lives. I have discovered through these eight weeks that there is a 'solution' to all that goes on, creating pain, in my mind and way of life - there is a constructive way to work with this.</p>

                <p>During the early part of this course I was dealing with a major stressor - for the first time in my life I did not escape from stress and worry in anticipation but rather used mindfulness to breath into and accept the horrible feelings. It worked! Some days later I got the important insight that my acute worries were really about 'What other people think of me' etc.  I shared this via email with Deirdre and received such a supportive, affirming ad non-directive reply. Her response touched me beyond any emotions experienced before. I was left feeling so whole and I will never forget it.</p>
                <h4>Carol, Rathfriland.</h4>

<br>
                <p>Having heard a lot about mindfulness I was delighted to attend Deirdre’s eight week course. I
                        thoroughly enjoyed the course and gained a lot from it. I would highly recommend the course to
                        anyone- but particularly those who feel they are suffering from life’s stresses.</p>
                        <h4>Mary, Newcastle.</h4>
                    <br>

                        <p>Mindfulness is not complicated, and even though I'd been aware of its many benefits, I didn't
                        really 'do' it. Taking part in this course over 8 weeks helped me learn a great deal about
                        myself and got me started on a daily practice. Deirdre is a skilled and knowledgable facilitator
                        and her warmth and commitment to the practice of mindfulness meditation shine through in all of
                        her interactions with the group.</p>
                        <h4>Bronagh, Newcastle.</h4>

                        <br>
                        <p>This was a very well presented course with good facilitated group discussion. This will be so beneficial to daly life and I will plan to practice daily a I so enjoy the stillness and the listening to my mind and body. I have gained in acceptance and self-compassion. I have learnt to take time for myself and am more patient and less quick to judgement. I have noticed myself less reactive personally and professionally. Thank you Deirdre for a most enjoyable course. I plan to bring this practice into my daily life. what a skill to use in good times and in bad! - Explore feelings and allow mind and body to heal itself.</p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <p>I would like to comment on the course's content as being very well thought out and structured. It was gently and firmly directing us in such a positive way which I believe I will find to have a very positive long term effect on my way of behaving and living my life in the future! Thank you.</p>

                        <br>
        
                        <p>I decided to do this course to seek some balance in my life and reduce reactivity to stress and anxiety. It was a very well paced course with time to engage with the principles and practices. Doing it as a group gave the opportunity to learn from each others experiences. These practices teach you how to introduce a space and time into every day problems so that there is much more opportunity to step back and examine before reacting but also allows time to deal with the pain or upset. I have gained such a sense of perspective in both every day situations and in longer term issues. I am now enjoying the present more in all its joys and difficulties. I find I am supporting myself more so that I can support others - so I see changes in relationships. I wish to spend time now on building on the longer meditation practices, to examine more where my learned experiences came from and maybe relearn better responses. This course will continue to unfold!</p>
