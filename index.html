            <h2 class="title">Welcome</h2>

            <div class="written">

                <p>I am very fortunate to offer mindfulness training in my mindfulness studio, set in the powerful and peaceful setting of the Mourne Mountains. I also regularly run mindfulness programmes in the city of Newry, which is within easy distance of Armagh, Dundalk, Banbridge and many other population centres.</p>

                <p>I am a professionally trained counsellor, psychotherapist and mindfulness trainer. My work is supervised and my training and practice meet internationally recognised standards of best practice. I deliver what is generally considered the gold standard training in mindfulness the eight week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction programme/ mindfulness based cognitive therapy programme. (MBSR/MBCT).</p>

                <p>I am committed to the highest standards of training and delivery so that people in Northern Ireland may have the best possible opportunity to access the transformative potential of mindfulness meditation and practices. I also offer one to one mindfulness coaching and a mindfulness informed counselling and psychotherapy service.</p>

                <p>It is a real joy to offer this 'way of life' and to do my best to live it and have my own life enhanced by the joy and peace that over time it has brought to me. You are most welcome to attend anything that I am offering and to make contact with questions.</p>
                
                <p>Warmly,</p>
                <p>Deirdre.</p>

                    <p>Whilst this is an ancient practice, it is only in recent decades that science and medicine have
                        come to recognise and prove the capacity of mindfulness to improve the quality of people's
                        lives; helping anyone living with the stress of illness, injury or pain, anyone working with
                        depression, anxiety or recovering from addiction and more broadly anyone wanting to improve
                        their relationship with the daily challenges of stress. It promotes self awareness, self
                        regulation, self compassion and a stable, centred way of being.</p>

                    <p>This was a very well presented course with good facilitated group discussion. This will be so beneficial to daly life and I will plan to practice daily as I so enjoy the stillness and the listening to my mind and body. I have gained in acceptance and self-compassion. I have learnt to take time for myself and am more patient and less quick to judgement. I have noticed myself less reactive personally and professionally. Thank you Deirdre for a most enjoyable course. I plan to bring this practice into my daily life. what a skill to use in good times and in bad! - Explore feelings and allow mind and body to heal itself.</p>

                    <p>I would like to comment on the course's content as being very well thought out and structured. It was gently and firmly directing us in such a positive way which I believe I will find to have a very positive long term effect on my way of behaving and living my life in the future! Thank you.</p>

                    <h4>Kevin</h4>
                    <br>

                    <p>I decided to do this course to seek some balance in my life and reduce reactivity to stress and anxiety. It was a very well paced course with time to engage with the principles and practices. Doing it as a group gave the opportunity to learn from each others experiences. These practices teach you how to introduce a space and time into every day problems so that there is much more opportunity to step back and examine before reacting but also allows time to deal with the pain or upset. I have gained such a sense of perspective in both every day situations and in longer term issues. I am now enjoying the present more in all its joys and difficulties. I find I am supporting myself more so that I can support others - so I see changes in relationships. I wish to spend time now on building on the longer meditation practices, to examine more where my learned experiences came from and maybe relearn better responses. This course will continue to unfold!</p>

                <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>

                <p>Mindfulness is a simple practice that connects us to our natural sense of presence, stability and
                    balance. Mindfulness is a way of being that arises when we pay attention, on purpose, deeply and
                    without judgment, to whatever is occurring in the present moment.
                    It involves adopting a friendly attitude to whatever we notice.</p>
