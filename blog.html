    <h1>Don’t be ‘At yourself' and take a rest</h1>

    <h2>August 8th 2014</h2>

    <p>It feels right, now that some time has elapsed, to reflect a little on the Eight Week Course that I ran
        here last spring.
        The spring really was glorious. The sun shone, birds sang and the mountains accompanied us as we
        explored and experimented with this thing called Mindfulness. I felt so fortunate to be offering this
        training in such an environment.
        The presence of the solid stable mountains sure helped us settle and begin to learn 'the art of just
        being’. </p>

    <p>And as I ask myself now what impressions have really stayed with me the following occurs to me…
    </p>

    <p>The theme of how we are always ‘picking' at ourselves, trying to ‘fix' ourselves or 'solve the problem'
        of ourselves and our ‘flawed’ lives. Is that familiar? There is great value in becoming aware of just
        how ‘wearing’ this is, of what this costs us emotionally and physically.
    </p>

    <p>And Mindfulness offers an alternative way of approaching life; inviting us to 'let ourselves be', to
        develop a practice of being present to and with ourselves moment by moment by moment, without any
        attempt to fix or change. </p>

    <p>This isn’t easy though. That habit of ‘picking’ at ourselves, judging, fixing is fairly engrained but
        with commitment and time something starts to shift. What a relief! We need this - this pausing, just
        being, in a little stillness and feeling a comforting quiet inside. Moments when we get to feel whole
        and connected and settled. Moments of letting our agendas drop and just being in the unfolding stream of
        our lives. This is such good medicine for minds and bodies. This simple practice is a deep salve for
        frayed minds, hearts and bodies.</p>

    <p>The other theme that emerged was just how uncomfortable it often is, in our bodies and in our minds, when
        we begin to practice mindfulness. Minds and bodies squirm, restlessness, agitation even, arises within
        us. It takes courage and a lot of perseverance. Did I mention that it takes A LOT of perseverance? :)
        And of course then the judging mind goes “I am no good at this either”. This is, be reassured, all
        entirely natural and with space, time and a lot of kindness towards ourselves we settle into these
        practices. Ah….. but in the beginning that restless mind and body can really be a pain! :)</p>

    <p>And finally another theme that came through strongly was how we have lost the art of resting Our bodies
        and minds are over-stimulated and over-taxed and we seem to have forgotten the art of resting. And I
        don’t mean zoning out e.g in front of the telly. I do mean the deliberate, intentional act of regularly
        taking time to slow right down and do the gentle activities that feel nurturing and restorative. We live
        in such a culture of striving it is perhaps not so very surprising that rest has been a casualty.</p>

    <p>As the spring eight week course drew to a close though and participants explored their plans for
        carrying forward their mindful living there was a real desire to build in routines e.g at bedtime, that
        would allow rest to re-establish its place at the centre of our lives.

        <h1>Remarking on the Unremarkable</h1>

        <h2>April 14th 2014</h2>

        <p>One map that underpins Mindfulness can be described in the following way;</p>

        <p>All experience has a 'feeling tone’, either
            Pleasant,
            Unpleasant
            or neutral. </p>

        <p>Our natural tendency is to chase the pleasant, avoid or push away the negative and ‘zone out’ the
            neutral.</p>

        <p>Mindfulness as a practice is the opening equally to all three - to just be wholeheartedly present to
            and
            aware of, a ALL experience - regardless.
            Bringing kindly awareness to it all. </p>

        <p>In particular the experience which registers with us as neutral is of interest to me at the moment.
            This
            has been a very active practice for me for these last few weeks. I have been actively seeking out
            the
            neutral -bringing it into the foreground, as it were.
        </p>

        <p>The following might offer some flavour;</p>


        <p>...the cuff of a wellington boot rubs along a calf muscle , the sound and texture of granola scraped
            off
            a breakfast bowl, the faces of drivers in oncoming cars, the sound of my own footsteps, yes often
            the
            sound of my own footsteps, many many sounds, the feel of the door handle under my hand, this is what
            makes up a life, isn’t it - the unremarkable yet when noticed…..

        <p>One of my motivations in this practice is that i believe that at the end of our lives all these
            moments
            would be suddenly revealed as ‘the heart of life’ ; the insight that these ‘neutral’ moments are
            really
            what life was made of - and that perhaps you missed it, that perhaps you hadn’t shown up for your
            own
            life.</p>

        <p> Jon Kabat-Zinn the founder of The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction programme that I teach, has an
            often quoted phrase
        </p>

        <p><i>“you only have moments to live”</i>

            ….the sound of a door opening, the feel of the pen between thumb and forefinger, the welcome silence
            that rushes in at that moment when the kitchen fan is turned off…..

        <h1>Mind-weather 2</h1>

        <h2>April 2nd 2014</h2>

        <p>I am going to speak about mind weather again, because that language is around for me at the
            moment.</p>

        <p> It is important I think to become aware that the weather of the mind is not “who” we are- but is
            rather
            something that ‘arises’ within us. Arises and falls away actually because everything is constantly
            moving and changing if you watch carefully enough.
        </p>

        <p> Mind states come and go. Mind weather. Low moods, restless moods, gladness, agitated thoughts,
            busyness, it rolls on, moving through us.</p>

        <p>In mindfulness practice we learn to find a still place and a kind place, within ourselves, that just
            observes this with quiet understanding. And we really come to directly experience that we are not
            our
            mind states. Some storms coming through us are fierce and some days it is a gentle breeze. But
            always
            the sky is there, simply a backdrop to it all. Just like our mindful awareness. The cognitive
            therapists
            call this metacognitive awareness - the ability to observe our thoughts and feelings coming and
            going
            and it is a very important and protective resource; especially if we are prone to acutely low moods
            or
            intense mind states.</p>

        <p>May we all learn to find a place where we are not pulled off balance (or where we can return quickly
            enough to balance) by each passing change in the weather.

        <h1>Mind-weather</h1>

        <h2>March 14th 2014</h2>

        <p>
            Today I am feeling somewhat rattled and a bit churned up inside. Yesterday I was full of energy and
            today, mostly because I have been hit by a virus, I feel very different.
        </p>

        <p>
            So reflecting on this i ask “ How can mindfulness as a philosophy and a practice support me in
            this?"
            It is a familiar one, isn’t it, this rapid change of mood or energy. (it is kind of, like the funny
            way
            we are permanently surprised by the changes in weather in this part of the world :))
        </p>

        <p>
            Certainly Mindfulness helps me notice the changes of 'mind-state’ as opposed to being overtaken by
            them.
            it has taught me a great deal about how mood states permanently change. There isn’t much wisdom in
            resisting this process is there? it’s called being a human being.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also these practices have taught me not to try to hold on to how I was feeling, even moments ago;
            how to
            just keep re-booting, starting afresh as it were. It is a lot less exhausting living this way, not
            setting myself up in opposition to the flow of life; and somehow the changing weather of the mind
            isn’t
            quite as troublesome as it once was.
