            <h1>Remarking on the Unremarkable</h1>

            <h2>April 14th 2014</h2>

            <p>One map that underpins Mindfulness can be described in the following way;</p>

            <p>All experience has a 'feeling tone’, either
                Pleasant,
                Unpleasant
                or neutral. </p>

            <p>Our natural tendency is to chase the pleasant, avoid or push away the negative and ‘zone out’ the
                neutral.</p>

            <p>Mindfulness as a practice is the opening equally to all three - to just be wholeheartedly present to and
                aware of, a ALL experience - regardless.
                Bringing kindly awareness to it all. </p>

            <p>In particular the experience which registers with us as neutral is of interest to me at the moment. This
                has been a very active practice for me for these last few weeks. I have been actively seeking out the
                neutral -bringing it into the foreground, as it were.
            </p>

            <p>The following might offer some flavour;</p>


            <p>...the cuff of a wellington boot rubs along a calf muscle , the sound and texture of granola scraped off
                a breakfast bowl, the faces of drivers in oncoming cars, the sound of my own footsteps, yes often the
                sound of my own footsteps, many many sounds, the feel of the door handle under my hand, this is what
                makes up a life, isn’t it - the unremarkable yet when noticed…..

            <p>One of my motivations in this practice is that i believe that at the end of our lives all these moments
                would be suddenly revealed as ‘the heart of life’ ; the insight that these ‘neutral’ moments are really
                what life was made of - and that perhaps you missed it, that perhaps you hadn’t shown up for your own
                life.</p>

            <p> Jon Kabat-Zinn the founder of The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction programme that I teach, has an
                often quoted phrase
            </p>

            <p> <i>“you only have moments to live”</i>

                ….the sound of a door opening, the feel of the pen between thumb and forefinger, the welcome silence
                that rushes in at that moment when the kitchen fan is turned off…..

            <h1>Mind-weather 2</h1>

            <h2>April 2nd 2014</h2>

            <p>I am going to speak about mind weather again, because that language is around for me at the moment.</p>

            <p> It is important I think to become aware that the weather of the mind is not “who” we are- but is rather
                something that ‘arises’ within us. Arises and falls away actually because everything is constantly
                moving and changing if you watch carefully enough.
            </p>

            <p> Mind states come and go. Mind weather. Low moods, restless moods, gladness, agitated thoughts,
                busyness, it rolls on, moving through us.</p>

            <p>In mindfulness practice we learn to find a still place and a kind place, within ourselves, that just
                observes this with quiet understanding. And we really come to directly experience that we are not our
                mind states. Some storms coming through us are fierce and some days it is a gentle breeze. But always
                the sky is there, simply a backdrop to it all. Just like our mindful awareness. The cognitive therapists
                call this metacognitive awareness - the ability to observe our thoughts and feelings coming and going
                and it is a very important and protective resource; especially if we are prone to acutely low moods or
                intense mind states.</p>

            <p>May we all learn to find a place where we are not pulled off balance (or where we can return quickly
                enough to balance) by each passing change in the weather.
            </p>

            <h1>Mind-weather</h1>

            <h2>March 14th 2014</h2>

            <p>
                Today I am feeling somewhat rattled and a bit churned up inside. Yesterday I was full of energy and
                today, mostly because I have been hit by a virus, I feel very different.
            </p>

            <p>
                So reflecting on this i ask “ How can mindfulness as a philosophy and a practice support me in this?"
                It is a familiar one, isn’t it, this rapid change of mood or energy. (it is kind of, like the funny way
                we are permanently surprised by the changes in weather in this part of the world :))
            </p>

            <p>
                Certainly Mindfulness helps me notice the changes of 'mind-state’ as opposed to being overtaken by them.
                it has taught me a great deal about how mood states permanently change. There isn’t much wisdom in
                resisting this process is there? it’s called being a human being.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also these practices have taught me not to try to hold on to how I was feeling, even moments ago; how to
                just keep re-booting, starting afresh as it were. It is a lot less exhausting living this way, not
                setting myself up in opposition to the flow of life; and somehow the changing weather of the mind isn’t
                quite as troublesome as it once was.
