            <h1>MBSR/MBCT Courses Overview</h1>

            <p>
                Although Mindfulness is rooted in Eastern spiritual traditions, in recent years it has been combined
                with aspects of western psychology to form a secular educational programme, usually taught across eight
                weeks.
                The original 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Programme (MBSR) was developed in 1979 at the
                University of Massachusetts Medical Centre (UMass) by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn. Subsequently the programme has
                been adapted by others in numerous psychological and medical settings to address the specific health
                needs of various groups. it has also been adapted for more general use in the community.
                Extensive research shows that MBSR is beneficial to patients with medical conditions (including chronic
                illness and pain, high blood pressure, cancer, vascular and respiratory disorders etc.) and
                psychological distress (including anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances). MBSR has become
                part of a newly recognised field of integrative medicine within behavioural medicine. There are
                currently MBSR courses running in 720 hospitals and medical centres in the U.S.
            </p>

            <p>
                More recently, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for recurrent depression courses have been
                developed by Zindel Segal, Mark Williams and John Teasdale. Based on the MBSR programme and including
                aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), the MBCT course was originally designed specifically for
                people who experience recurrent bouts of depression. Mindfulness training assist participants in
                disengaging from habitual ‘automatic’ unhelpful cognitive patterns. The pattern of mind that makes
                people vulnerable to depressive relapse is called 'rumination', in which the mind repetitively reruns
                negative thoughts. The core skill that MBCT is teaching is to intentionally ‘shift mental gears’. These
                Mindfulness-Based courses are not group therapy, but are educational in nature.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is little emphasis in MBCT, as in conventional CBT, on striving to change our beliefs or the
                content of our thoughts. Instead the training in on becoming more aware, moment by moment, of physical
                sensations and of thoughts and feelings as mental events. This provides a ‘decentred’ relationship to
                thoughts and feelings in which we can see them as aspects of experience which move through our
                awareness, rather that a fixed reality.
                “The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently endorsed MBCT as a treatment for
                prevention of relapse. Research has shown that people who have been clinically depressed 3 or more
                times, find that taking the program and learning these skills helps to reduce considerably their chances
                that depression will return. The evidence from two randomized clinical trials of MBCT indicates that it
                reduces rates of relapse by 50% among patients who suffer from recurrent depression.” (Ma and Teasdale,
                2004., Teasdale et al 2000).
                An synthesised version of the two above named courses has been developed by the Centre of Mindfulness
                Research and Practice at the University of Wales, Bangor. They have called their programme MBCT for
                Stress, using aspects of both MBSR and MBCT for a broader population. The course borrows heavily from
                MBSR and includes some aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>
