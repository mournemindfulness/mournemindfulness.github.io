                <h1>MBSR/MBCT Courses Overview</h1>

                <p>This Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) /Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programme consists
                    of eight weekly 2.5 hour classes and one full day of mindfulness practice.Cost for full programme is
                    £295.</p>

                <p>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an eight week programme created and pioneered in the USA by
                    Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn over the past 35 years in the Massachussetts Medical Centre. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive
                    Therapy (MBCT) for Stress & Low Mood was developed by Professors Mark Williams, Zindel Segal and John
                    Teasdale. They adapted the original Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course developed by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn
                    at the University of Massachusetts Medical Centre in 1979.</p>

                <p>Both of these courses have a strong evidence base for assisting people in managing stress, low mood, depression,
                    anxiety, illness & pain. Studies have shown that committed participation in an MBSR/MBCT course can often
                    lead to lasting positive effects on health and well-being. This 8-week course will introduce participants
                    to different forms of mindfulness practice, including sitting meditation, body awareness and gentle mindful
                    movement. As the emphasis is on bringing mindfulness into everyday life, home practice will be an important
                    aspect of the course.</p>

                <p>To benefit fully from the programme it is important that participants are willing to commit to engaging in
                    about 30 minutes of daily home meditation practice supported by a guided meditation - for the duration
                    of the course. Participants learn a different way of being with experience, bringing attention to what
                    is happening here and now and staying with that direct experience.</p>

                <p>The eight weeks of the Mindfulness program helps you to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Become more aware of how your mind works</li>
                    <li> Notice the times when you get lost in automatic pilot / thinking / old negative patterns that activate
                        downward mood spirals.
                    </li>
                    <li> Practice a different way of being with experience</li>
                    <li> Get more connected to yourself and your body and attuned to what is happening in the moment</li>
                    <li> Wake up to life happening inside of you and all around you, savouring moments instead of ‘being lost
                        in thought’</li>
                    <li> Develop kindness and compassion for yourself and others and acceptance of yourself just as you are</li>
                    <li> Let go of the struggle, force, resistance and cultivate attitudes of patience, trust, non judgement,
                        non striving, openness, acceptance</li>
                    <li> See options and choices in every scenario.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This substantial program is shown to improve emotional wellbeing and be an effective treatment for anxiety
                    or low mood difficulties. Mindfulness helps us to; open to life rather than struggle against it, respond
                    to challenges rather than react, show compassion towards ourselves rather than judgement and appreciation
                    rather than negativity - allowing us to feel more connected, more open, and more deeply alive.</p>

                    The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently endorsed MBCT as a treatment for prevention of relapse.
                    Research has shown that people who have been clinically depressed 3 or more times, find that taking the
                    program and learning these skills helps to reduce considerably their chances that depression will return.
                    The evidence from two randomized clinical trials of MBCT indicates that it reduces rates of relapse by
                    50% among patients who suffer from recurrent depression.” (Ma and Teasdale, 2004., Teasdale et al 2000).
                    An synthesised version of the two above named courses has been developed by the Centre of Mindfulness
                    Research and Practice at the University of Wales, Bangor. They have called their programme MBCT for Stress,
                    using aspects of both MBSR and MBCT for a broader population. The course borrows heavily from MBSR and
                    includes some aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy.
