      <h2>What is Somatic Experiencing?</h2>
      <p>
        Somatic Experiencing® is a body-based therapeutic approach developed by Dr. Peter Levine. It is designed to help people resolve trauma, chronic stress, and overwhelm by gently 
        guiding attention to internal sensations and supporting the body's natural ability to regulate and heal. Rather than retelling traumatic events, SE helps restore balance through 
        attuned physical awareness, movement, and pacing.

      <h2>Deirdre's Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Through her training with <a href="https://www.irelandse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Somatic Experiencing Ireland (IrelandSE)</a>, Deirdre supports individuals in recovering from trauma, anxiety, chronic tension, and life transitions.
        Her work emphasizes safety, body awareness, and a compassionate therapeutic relationship. Sessions are suitable for those seeking to reconnect with their inner resources and move 
        toward resilience and ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deirdre also brings a background in Gestalt psychotherapy, which informs her relational, client-centered style. She offers sessions online and in person, and welcomes those 
        exploring trauma healing for the first time.
